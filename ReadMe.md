# Idea

We are working towards an idea that moves to integrate and simplify the tedious task of taking attendance in classes.
- We are trying to make a suitable web app that will provide smart attendance with the help of facial recognition and make an easy to use and an eye catching portal wih sign in options for both the student and the instructor. 

### Instructor Portal 

The instructor will be able to access and modify the attendance of various classes that he or she is teaching. 
Steps to use the portal 
- Sign up on the web app. 
- Create a class for the students. 
- He will use a unique code to allow students to join the class. 
- Date wise mentioning of the attendance taken.
- He/She will upload the photo of the class on the portal and the job of the app is to mark the attendance. 

### Student Portal 

The student can check his attendance upto the current date of a particular class. 

Steps to use the portal 
- Sign up on the web app. 
- Join the class using the code provided. 
- Upload some clear images for the facial recognition.(option to update with time)
- Check his attendance for the previous dates. 

# Back End working 

- This project takes the help of image processing algorithms to recognize a particular person in an image and updates the attendance accordingly.
- Maintain a database of images for each student. 
- Update the sheet which mentions all the dates and students attendance. 
- Make a aesthetically pleasing portal with ease of use and simple instructions accessable by all.
